// 1.Creating and Using Cubit
// Learn how to create a Cubit class, extend Cubit<State>, and use the emit() method to output new states.
// Understand how to create state classes that are either single classes or part of a class hierarchy.

// 2. Cubit and Flutter Integration
// Use BlocProvider to provide a Cubit to a widget tree.
// Use BlocBuilder to listen for state changes and rebuild UI accordingly.
// Understand how BlocListener can be used for side effects without rebuilding the UI.

// 3. Advanced Topics
// Learn about the HydratedCubit for state persistence across app restarts.
// Understand how to handle complex state management with multiple Cubits working together or
// alongside other state management solutions.

// 4. Performance Considerations
// Optimize performance by ensuring Cubits do not rebuild unnecessary parts of the widget tree.
// Familiarize yourself with tools like flutter_bloc's BlocSelector for more selective state listening.
